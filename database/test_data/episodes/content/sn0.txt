This week we observe that the Net Neutrality battle is actually FAR from lost, ComputerWorld's Woody Leonard enumerates a crazy January of updates, "EternalBlue" is turning out to be far more eternal than we'd wish, will Flash EVER die? A new 0-day Flash exploit in the wild, what happens when you combine Shodan with Metasploit?, Firefox 59 takes another privacy enhancing step forward, a questionable means of sneaking data between systems, another fun SpinRite report from the field, some closing the loop feedback from our listeners, and a look at the early emergence of Meltdown and Spectre exploits appearing in the wild.

We invite you to read our show notes[2].
