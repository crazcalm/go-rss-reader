      <itunes:summary>In this episode of the ThoughtWorks Beacon Podcast, ThoughtWorkers Jonny LeRoy and Chelsea Komlo talk about security and specifically how it fits into the development process of an agile team.

Jonny and Chelsea begin by talking about the &quot;Security Sandwich&quot; - a concept first coined in ThoughtWorks' Technology Radar. https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar

&quot;We called it the security sandwich because the meat of your delivery was in the middle, but then security came on either side like the two pieces of bread, &quot; Jonny explained. &quot;And there would be some upfront security planning and documentation, and then some penetration testing and certification at the end. We are really on a mission to work out how to bake security processes into continuous delivery approaches.&quot;

The podcast continues with Chelsea and Jonny providing next steps for tech leaders who want to incorporate a security culture within their respective teams.

&quot;One thing that's important to remember is that you're never going to completely be 100% secure, but you also want to be able to know if something is happening and react. So when we think about security, we think about both hardening our systems and also reacting,&quot; Chelsea reminds listeners.

He makes a passionate case for LambdaCD’s approach of building your pipelines like you build your microservices - using such powerful tools like a functional programming language, version control, tests and refactoring. Finally, Florian outlines how the project evolved from a thought experiment into a library under active use and development and gives hints for upcoming contributors that want to help in shaping LambdaCD’s future.  http://www.lambda.cd/</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>One of the themes we highlighted in the April 2016 edition of the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar was “open source as a virtuous byproduct.”

That’s a fairly high-minded phrase. In this 30-minute podcast, ThoughtWorks' Technology Advisory Board Members Badri Janakiraman, Martin Fowler, Mike Mason and Rebecca Parsons discuss this theme and the general state of open source in the industry. The lively roundtable discussion touches on product development, security, technical culture, and machine learning as they relate to open source.

The podcast ends with a gentle reminder from Badri: &quot;The availability of tools and source code out there does not mean that we take away the responsibility of development teams in organizations to have discipline and rigor in their development processes.&quot;

      <itunes:summary>In this episode of the ThoughtWorks Beacon Podcast, Software Architect Neal Ford, Prasanna Pendse, Tech Principal,  and Jonny LeRoy, Head of Technology, North America, discuss blockchain, how it differs from Bitcoin and what the future holds for the technology. 

[Disclaimer: This podcast isn't an introduction to blockchain.  To the get the most out of it, you should have some knowledge of the technology.]

During the conversation, Neal cautions that the current problems with Bitcoin have nothing to do with the viability of blockchain as a technology, “but has everything to do with all the non-technical aspects of currency and how messy that is in the real world.”

The podcast closes with advice from Jonny on peeling back some of the underlying technologies to answer some key questions for technologists. How might you use blockchain? What types of problems could be solved with blockchain? 

These are really good questions to ask. The answer isn't always blockchain.

Enjoy this episode of the ThoughtWorks podcast and, as always, please share your feedback and ideas with us @thoughtworks.

This pattern describes the creation of one specific backend to provide functionality specifically to the need of a single client.

Johannes talks with Lukasz about the BFF pattern rooted in a Microservices environment. First, they explain the difference between UI fragment composition and the backend for frontends approach as two alternatives. Then they discuss how backend for frontends fit into a microservices architecture and how it can be structured organizationally. We close the episode by discussing how many backend for frontends are already out there.</itunes:summary>

Neal explains, &quot;When you introduce things like DevOps and continuous delivery, all of a sudden you change the level of granularity in which you can make changes in your architecture and that becomes a really huge enabler for being able to make decisions at a higher level...&quot;

Rebecca adds, &quot;What you need to do on Day One is think about what are the critical success factors for your architecture? Does it need to be highly available? Does it need to be highly scalable? Is security your major driving concern? Is it data loss? Those are all possible outcomes for architectures and all systems don't display the same kind of characteristics.

Is security your major driving concern? Is it data loss? Those are all possible outcomes for architectures and all systems don't display the same kind of characteristics. That's what we mean when we're talking about evolutionary architecture.&quot;</description>

      <itunes:summary>Our newest ThoughtWorks podcast is a thought provoking discussion between Sam Newman, consultant, and Erik Doernenburg, head of technology, ThoughtWorks Europe, in which they contemplate the advantages and disadvantages of microservices and cloud computing.

During the conversation, Erik advises listeners that the focus should be on the implementation of the actual services and not on the &quot;glue&quot; in between the services. 

Sam offers up an analogy, saying implementing an architecture based on microservices is like working with marble. You must chip away gradually. “It’s an incremental thing, not an upfront exercise,” he says.

Johannes Thönes met Chris Ford, Software Developer and ThoughtWorker from London, during XConf in Hamburg where he gave a talk on implementing Lenses in Clojure. In this 23 minute interview, Johannes talks with Chris about his experience with Lenses in Clojure. First they define what a Lense is and what you would want to do with it. Then they talk about the specifics of implementing Lenses in a programming language introducing the terms Functor and Function. We close the episode by talking about the possibility to implement lenses in other programming languages such as Java 8 or JavaScript.

      <itunes:summary>[Recorded at the May 12, 2015 Microservices Meetup in NY.] Dealing with a traffic spike amounting to half of Amazon’s traffic each day when new sales are announced is no easy matter. Michael Bryzek, co-founder of retailer Gilt Groupe, talks about the architectural and cultural evolution that took place as Gilt introduced microservices during its growth over the course of the past seven years.

Transitioning from a few monolithic systems to somewhere in the range of 300 to 400 microservices today presented a lot of challenges along the way. First describing how they decided to prioritize which parts of their system to optimize by breaking it into smaller, more optimized services, Bryzek covers some of the challenges that were encountered and how they went about solving them. He also describes some of the steps they took right up until today, when they have begun transitioning to Amazon’s AWS.

Successfully building a microservices architecture typically takes a strong culture of trust with teams that are empowered to do the right thing. Bryzek discusses some of the sources of inspiration they had when faced with the problem of developing trust while growing their engineering capability, and some of the other organizations whose lessons they looked to for ideas.</itunes:summary>

In this interview, Johannes Thönes talks to Scott about the prerequisites of being successful with a Microservice style architecture. First, you need to have an automatic deployment pipeline in place so you can deploy effectively and frequently to the cloud. You also need to have good DevOps practices and infrastructure automation around, so spinning up a dedicated server is not something that takes month.

Scott explains, that for being able to do Microservices, you need to have a clear understanding of the domain, which will give your Microservices their bounded context rooted in your domain. 

His advice for green field application, especially when you don’t have the practices in place, is to start with a monolith (or one lonely Microservices) and then split it up, when it makes sense. 

“Services need to evolve,&quot; he says.
